"MyHarmony" Protocol:

There seem to be two types of messages, command messages and data messages.

Command messages/responses:
1st byte is always 0xFF
2nd byte is the command (see below).
3rd byte is the sequence number, which ranges from 0x00 to 0x3F then rolls over
    => in messages from the remote, the uppermost bit will be set, eg:
    => if the sequence number in the message sent to the remote is 0x03, the 
    => response will have the sequence number 0x83.
4th byte is the number of parameters.
5th byte and on are the parameters.  Each parameter begins with a byte which
    indicates the number of bytes in the parameter.
    => if the parameter length byte is 0x80, then the parameter is a "string"
       of hex ASCII characters and is terminated by a 0x00.

Command message 0x01 - Read/Write a file.
	Parameters: 3
	Parameter 1: String; filename to read or write.  Known files:
		  Identity file is /sys/sysinfo
		  Config file is /cfg/usercfg
		  IR learn is /ir/ir_cap
	Parameter 2: String; 'W' for write, 'R' for read.
	Parameter 3: 4 bytes; length of data to write (only use for writes)
Response (to a read command):
	Parameters: 2
	Parameter 1: 1 byte; unknown.
	Parameter 1: 4 bytes; length of data that will be read.

Command message 0x03 - Data mode acknowledgement response.
	Parameters: 2
	Parameter 1: 1 byte; unknown; value seems to always be 0x05.
	Parameter 2: 1 byte; number of packets left to send, plus one.  If there
		  are more than 50 packets to send, 0x33 (51) is sent.  The end
		  of file message (0x7E) is included in the count.

Command message 0x04 - Data mode read start message (sent before get identity
	and IR data modes start)
	Parameters: 2
	Parameter 1: 1 byte; unknown; value seems to always be 0x06.
	Parameter 2: 1 byte; number of packets to send before expecting an
		  acknowledgement, minus one (ie, 0x33 [51] -> send 50 pkts).

Command message 0x05 - unknown (sent after writing a config file)
	Parameters: 2
	Parameter 1: 1 byte; unknown; value seems to always be 0x05.
	Parameter 2: 1 byte; unknown; value seems to always be 0x00.

Command message 0x06 - Write file checksum (after a write).
	Parameters: 7
	Parameter 1: 1 byte; unknown; value seems to always be 0x05.
	Parameter 2: 1 byte; unknown; value seems to always be 0x01.
	Parameter 3: String; Checksum Type (from XML), e.g., "XOR".
	Parameter 4: 2 bytes; Checksum Seed (from XML), e.g., "4321".
	Parameter 5: 4 bytes; unknown; value seems to always be 0x00000000.
		  (Might be Checksum "Offset" from XML)
	Parameter 6: 4 bytes; Checksum Length (from XML), e.g., "4db1".
	Parameter 7: 2 bytes; Checksum ExpectedValue (from XML), "5740".

Command message 0x07 - Reset sequence number to 0? (sent after reading identity,
		after writing a config file, and after learning IR)
	Parameters: 1
	Parameter 1: 1 byte; unknown; value seems to be 0x06 before write and
		  0x05 after

Special commands - some commands do not have sequence numbers in the 2nd byte:

Reset command: 0xFF 0xFF 0x02 0x01 0x01

Data messages:
Once the remote or the software switches to data mode, the packets are as
follows:
	1st byte: sequence number (uppermost bit set to 1 if from the remote)
	2nd byte: data length, eg: 0x3e for a full packet of 62 bytes
	    (uppermost bit will be set to 1 if from the remote)
	3rd-64th bytes: data

IR learning:
Once the remote is in IR learning mode, the packets received from the remote are
in the same format as the IR learning mode of pure HID remotes (see
protocol.txt)
